As of yet we can provide you these variants of the synchronization server*.


| Variant | Anki Desktop version | Anki Droid version | GitHub url | DockerHub url |
|--------|:--------------------:|:------------------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| [Legacy](#legacy-variant) |    2.1.19            |  2.9.1          | [GitHub](https://github.com/ankicommunity/docker-anki-sync-server) | [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kuklinistvan/anki-sync-server) |

<sup>*: a more recent version is coming soon...</sup>

### Legacy variant

The legacy variant is based on the original
[`anki-sync-server`](https://github.com/ankicommunity/anki-sync-server).
    
This is the battle-tested version. It does not support the most recent Anki
clients, however, as of writing, it is the version that you can probably safely
rely on.

Download mirrors for the old Anki clients (including the Android version) are
provided in the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/ankicommunity/docker-anki-sync-server).
