Hey there! If you are a newcomer, you are at the right place.

One of the main goals of this community is to make beginners the experience of
setting up our projects as seamlessly, as possible. If you are stuck, we hope that you'll find
the information you need.

If you don't, you may still contact us at
[Gitter](https://github.com/ankicommunity/) for help. Also, if you find that
something useful is missing from this manual and you have the time, we are happy
to [accept pull requests to this portal](https://github.com/ankicommunity/ankicommunity.github.io).
