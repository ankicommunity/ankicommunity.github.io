This is the repository that backs https://ankicommunity.github.io/.

## Pull requests are welcome

We thrive to provide you a user-friendly experience to our projects. However, if something is missing from our knowledge base, you are welcome to extend it!

## How to improve

Please fork the master branch, clone it, and run the server locally with 

```
mkdocs serve
```

Some tips for editing:

* Alter `mkdocs.yml` to create new navigation points
* Keep the page open in your browser to see your changes
  * You may restart the server if something seems "stuck"
* We suggest using the Typora editor for Markdown files
* We suggest using `linkchecker` to ensure there are no broken links after editing
