Our means of communication have evolved, and at the moment, the channels below are preferred.

## Long term forums

### Discourse

From general ideas, through long term issues to user support, please share your ideas, suggestions or questions here. As a rule of thumb, if your issue is not specific to a project, but would induce a longer conversation or should be kept for reference, please submit it here.

### Github issues

If your inquiry is specific to one of our projects, please move on to the issues of the specific repository.

## Ad-hoc communication

### Gitter 

If you have a quick question or idea to share, you can submit it immediately to our Gitter channel.

Keep in mind, however, that as Gitter is not quite suitable for keeping reference on your ideas, we may ask you to restate them on one of our long term forums if we think that your initiative should be kept and archived for later.

??? Note "Why Gitter?"

    Although [not all of us agree on the choice of this platform](https://github.com/ankicommunity/ankicommunity.github.io/issues/5), it is convenient for ad-hoc conversations. With a GitHub account, you can join the channel at the push of a button.

    One of its biggest disadvantages, though, is that it is quite hard to find previous conversations, therefore, for further discussions and ellaboration, we encourage you to hold the longer topics on one of our long term forums.
